# Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection in Children Using Static Facial Features and Deep Neural Networks

### Description
Autism, formally termed as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), encompasses a far-reaching spectrum of neurodevelopmental conditions that are characterized into diverse symptoms and challenges. Individuals with autism may experience troubles in social interaction, communication, and behavior, which could range from mild to severe. Core features of autism include challenges in understanding and interpreting social cues, engaging in reciprocal conversations, and exhibiting repetitive behaviors or intense interests. This project proposes an innovative approach centered on the analysis of static facial features using deep neural networks to identify the child whether they are suffering from Autism. In this project our research focuses on the utilizing the deep learning techniques to analyze and identify subtle patterns in static facial images of the children, aiding in the timely and accurate detection of autism in children. Here we are gathering a comprehensive datasetâ€™s of static facial images of the children to serve as deep learning model for training and validation, The study focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract and analyze the subtle facial features associated with the autism, Employing cross-validation techniques and relevant performance metrics to assess the accuracy of the model and its effectiveness in autism identification. The system will be fine-tuned and optimized for high precision, recall, and overall diagnostic capability. By harnessingthe power of deep neural networks, we aim to provide a non-invasive, cost-effective, and efficient tool for autism diagnosis, ultimately facilitating in early intervention and improvising the outcomes for affected individuals.

### Proposed System:
The "Identification of Autism in Children Using Static Facial Features and Deep Neural 
Networks" project proposes a data-driven solution to address the existing challenges: 

1. Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of static facial images of children, both 
with and without autism, to serve as the basis for the deep learning model's training and 
validation. This dataset will capture a wide range of facial expressions and variations in 
children with ASD.

2. Deep Neural Network Development: Develop and fine-tune deep neural networks, such 
as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract and analyze subtle facial features 
associated with autism. The model will be trained to identify patterns, expressions, and 
markers that distinguish children with ASD from their neurotypical peers.

3. Feature Extraction and Classification: Utilize the trained neural network to extract 
relevant facial features and classify individuals into autistic and non-autistic categories. This 
classification process will be based on the learned patterns from the dataset.
 
4. Validation and Evaluation: Employ cross-validation techniques and relevant performance 
metrics to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness in autism identification. The system 
will be fine-tuned and optimized for high precision, recall, and overall diagnostic capability.
 
5. Non-Invasive and Early Diagnosis: The proposed system aims to provide a non-invasive, 
objective, and efficient method for early autism diagnosis in children. It can be integrated into 
healthcare settings and assist clinicians in their diagnostic process.
